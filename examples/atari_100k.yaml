  # [2]: "We follow the evaluation protocol of Machado et al. (2018) with 200M
  # environment steps, action repeat of 4, a time limit of 108,000 steps per
  # episode that correspond to 30 minutes of game play, no access to life
  # information, full action space, and sticky actions. Because the world model
  # integrates information over time, DreamerV2 does not use frame stacking.
  # The experiments use a single-task setup where a separate agent is trained
  # for each game. Moreover, each agent uses only a single environment instance.
